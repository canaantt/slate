<ul>
<li><p>use nextTick() instead of setImmediate() to schedule microtasks with node 0.10. Later versions of 
nodes are not affected as they were already using nextTick(). Note that using nextTick() might 
trigger a depreciation warning on 0.10 as described at https://github.com/cujojs/when/issues/410.
The reason why nextTick() is preferred is that is setImmediate() would schedule a macrotask 
instead of a microtask and might result in a different scheduling.
If needed you can revert to the former behavior as follow:</p>

<p>var Promise = require(&lsquo;es6-promise&rsquo;).Promise;
Promise._setScheduler(setImmediate);</p></li>
</ul>
