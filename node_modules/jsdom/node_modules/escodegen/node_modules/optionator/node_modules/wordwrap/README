<p>Returns a function that takes a string and returns a new string.</p>

<p>Pad out lines with spaces out to column <code class="prettyprint">start</code> and then wrap until column
<code class="prettyprint">stop</code>. If a word is longer than <code class="prettyprint">stop - start</code> characters it will overflow.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;soft&rdquo; mode, split chunks by <code class="prettyprint">/(\S+\s+/</code> and don&rsquo;t break up chunks which are
longer than <code class="prettyprint">stop - start</code>, in &ldquo;hard&rdquo; mode, split chunks with <code class="prettyprint">/\b/</code> and break
up chunks longer than <code class="prettyprint">stop - start</code>.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-hard-start-stop">wrap.hard(start, stop)</h2>

<p>Like <code class="prettyprint">wrap()</code> but with <code class="prettyprint">params.mode = &quot;hard&quot;</code>.</p>
