<h1 id="data-provenance">Data Provenance</h1>

<p>To fit into the Oncoscape Data Visualization model, we further processed the raw data described in <a href='#data-content'>Data Content</a>. This section is dedicated to explain the data model and process. The two major processes include <a href='#cluster'>cluster</a> and <a href='#network'>network</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cluster">Cluster</h2>

<p>The cluster collections are generated to fit into two tools &lsquo;Markers and Patients&rsquo; and &#39;PCA&rsquo; in Oncoscape. There are two Schemas for clutster collections: Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Principal component analysis (PCA).</p>

<h3 id="mds">MDS</h3>

<p><strong>Input Data:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href='#data-type7'>cnv_thd</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href='#data-type7'>mut01</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong></p>

<p>cnv_thd and mut01 were combined and the distance matrix were calculated best represent the similarity of individual sample in the N-dimensional space.</p>

<p><strong>Schema:</strong></p>

<h3 id="pca">PCA</h3>

<p><strong>Input Data:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href='#data-type7'>expr</a> including RNA and Protein</p></li>
<li><p><a href='#data-type7'>cnv</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong></p>

<p>The collection of each class will be processed respectively that distance matrices were generated to best represent the similarity of individual sample in the N-dimensional space.</p>

<p><strong>Schema:</strong></p>

<p>The naming convention of the derived collections includes the information from method, geneset as well as data class listed below.</p>

<h2 id="network">Network</h2>

<p>The network collections are generated to fit to&#39;Markers and Patients&rsquo; in Oncoscape. There are three Schemas for network collections: edges, patient weights and gene weights.</p>

<h3 id="edges">Edges</h3>

<p>Edges contain the information to define the edges connecting one patient sample with one gene. For each record the value may be integer between -2 to +2. If one gene in one patient sample has copy number variation, this information will be represented as -2 (deletion), or -1 (loss), or +1 (gain), or +2 (amplificaiton). If this gene on this patient sample doesn&rsquo;t have copy number variation but point mutation, this information will be represented as &#39;0&rsquo;. Otherwise, no record will be shown. </p>

<h3 id="patient-degrees">Patient degrees</h3>

<p>For a certain dataset, patient degrees record the number of altered genes (copy number variation and point mutation) for each patient.</p>

<h3 id="gene-degrees">Gene degrees</h3>

<p>For a certain dataset, gene degrees record the number of patients who have this gene altered (either caused by copy number varation or point mutation).</p>
